# M5 Crystal Firmware — Developer Guide

## Process managment

In the main loop, two processes are continuously running: the status bar process (if it is not turned off) and the running function process.
Each process independently processes button clicks and draws the interface, be it a menu or a unique UI. Each process except the status bar process has its own unique process ID (PID).

The global variable `process` stores the current PID. Based on it, `switcher` is determined which process function to run.
As soon as the value of this variable changes, the process will be changed. However, you should use functions from `utils/procManagmentUtils.h`. They reset various global variables, ensuring stable operation.

Check out the full list of utilities in the [documentation](./utils.md)

## Configuration & Settings

The configuration file is stored in the file `system/conf.h`
The file stores the default firmware settings.
Variable values ​​are overwritten by saved settings in the device.

Preferences are loaded using the `loadPreferences` function from the `system/loadPreferences.h` file. This function replaces the values ​​of variables from globals.h and conf.h with those stored in the device memory. If there is no value saved, the default one from conf.h/globals.h is used instead.

```cpp
volume = getData("volume", volume);
Serial.printf("Volume: %d\n", volume / volumeDividor);
DEVICE.Speaker.setVolume(volume);
```

## Display

| Parameter | Value |
| - | - |
| Display width | 240 px |
| Display height | 135 px |
| Status bar height | 20 px |
| Scroll bar width | 5px |

## Fonts and text sizes

| Variable | Base multiplier |
| - | - |
| `TINY_TEXT` | 1x |
| `SMALL_TEXT` | 1.5x |
| `MEDIUM_TEXT` | 2x |
| `BIG_TEXT` | 3x |
| `HUGE_TEXT` | 4x |
| `MENU_TEXT` | 1.8x (for menu items) |

Text sizes are multiplied by a per-font scale factor from `fontScales[]` to normalize line height across fonts.

To switch fonts call `applyFont(index)` — it sets the font on all canvases and recalculates the text size variables. Everything is declared in `src/system/globals.h`.

## Colors

Throughout the firmware, two primary colors are used, `BGCOLOR` and `FGCOLOR`, sometimes an additional `TFT_DARKGREY`.
The colors array is declared in `src/system/globals.h`.

FGCOLOR can be changed in the firmware settings `settings -> colors`.

These colors, already defined in M5GFX, were chosen as the main ones.

| Color | Color name |
| - | - |
| TFT_WHITE | WHITE |
| TFT_RED | RED |
| TFT_ORANGE | ORANGE |
| TFT_YELLOW | YELLOW |
| TFT_GREEN | GREEN |
| TFT_CYAN | CYAN |
| TFT_BLUE | BLUE |
| TFT_VIOLET | VIOLET |
| TFT_MAGENTA | MAGENTA |

In the future, it is possible to add a third color in the form of a darker version of the colors described above, or the ability to select a color from the full RGB spectrum.
